# Data Analysis with Python 🐍📊

This repository contains a collection of Python-based data analysis projects focused on different datasets and techniques including EDA, linear and logistic regression, and domain-specific insights (e.g. sports, finance, health).

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. [Covid 19 India.ipynb](./Covid%2019%20India.ipynb)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the COVID-19 India dataset to track confirmed, cured, and death cases across states. Includes visualizations for top-affected states and time series trends with linear regression on Maharashtra data.

> **Tech Used**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

---

### 2. [EDA on FIFA Dataset.ipynb](./EDA%20on%20FIFA%20Dataset.ipynb)
Analyzes the FIFA 20 dataset to explore player nationalities, wages, skills, and club-level statistics. Visual comparisons are drawn between top players and teams like Real Madrid and Germany.

> **Tech Used**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

### 3. [EDA on IPL dataset.ipynb](./EDA%20on%20IPL%20dataset.ipynb)
Performs EDA on Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data to analyze match outcomes, team performance, toss influence, and key players. Includes bar plots and pattern identification.

> **Tech Used**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

---

### 4. [Financial Analysis (Logistic Regression).ipynb](./Financial%20Analysis%20(Logistic%20Regression).ipynb)
Applies logistic regression to a financial dataset to predict binary outcomes such as loan approval or customer behavior. Covers preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

> **Tech Used**: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression

---

### 5. [Linear Regression in Python.ipynb](./Linear%20Regression%20in%20Python.ipynb)
Builds and trains a simple linear regression model on a synthetic dataset to understand relationships between variables. Covers steps like data splitting, training, testing, and visualization.

> **Tech Used**: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
